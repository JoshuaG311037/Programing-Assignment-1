#In this programming assignment I was able to learn how to utilize the different tools that python has in order to complete the task. 

#For the first problem I was required to make a function to sort a word/words alphabetically. So in order to sort the given word alphabetically, I used the function sorted(word). This function would sort the word in accending order basing on ASCII Table. Then using .join the letters would not be printed as individual elements but as one line of letters with no spacing.

#For the second problem I was required to create a program that would detect the words "smile", "mad", "grin", and "sad" and turn it to its emoticon version. So first I made a dictionary for the emoticons so that I can use it later. Then using the .split in order to turn my string to a list. Then using a for loop in which it would try to read the word if it is one of the words in the emoticon dictionary. Once the loop detects a word it would replace the word with the emoticon that is paired to the word. Then the function would return the sentence with the emoticon.

#For the third problem I was required to create a program that would outupt the first, middle and, last elements of a set. For this program I first made set with my own elements then using the code "first, *middle, last". Then I printed it out with a format of "First:  Middle:  Last:" with its elemets as its outputs.
